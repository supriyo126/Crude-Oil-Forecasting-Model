# 🛢️ Crude Oil Price Forecasting Model (WTI)

This repository contains a machine learning-based forecasting pipeline to predict West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil prices using ensemble models (Random Forest & XGBoost), enriched with macroeconomic indicators and geopolitical context. Interactive Tableau dashboards further visualize the data, trends, and model performance.

---

## 📌 Project Objectives

- Forecast short-term WTI crude oil prices using supervised learning techniques.
- Evaluate the impact of macroeconomic events (OPEC decisions, interest rate shifts, geopolitical tensions) on price movement.
- Visualize trends, prediction intervals, error distributions, and production patterns through dashboards.
